# Overview of Gameplay

"VIXI: I Have Lived" is a 2D single-player point-and-click puzzle game which implements rhythm matching mini-games. The core concept of our game is that our main protagonist is a mafia member who is sent to hell after death, and must complete a series of challenges in order to escape. The game will consist of 4 areas in total, each with various simple puzzles and mini-games. Each area is relatively unique, where the player can freely walk around and interact with items and the surrounding environment. Some items will require the player to complete a rhythm matching mini-game in order to interact with that item. At the end of each level there is a boss that they must defeat. The boss battle is essentially an extended and more difficult version of the rhythm matching games. We believe that the variety of puzzles provided to the player will make the game engaging and fun, because the gameâ€™s content will not get stale, despite being relatively simple.
